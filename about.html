            <p>Founded in 1856, by brilliant mastermind Tomisin Ogunnubi, Crypton Inc. started out as Softwares and Co just as an approach
            to briefly explain the aim of the company. Due to her limited resources she started out with a team of five consisting of two 
            of her friends and other family members in her garage back at home. Very soon, her work began to sell and many companies began
            to invest and five years down the line, The Nigerian Army reached out to the company which led to the production of the 'Endenigma 
            machine'

            <p> The Crypton 2.0 is an encrypting and decrypting program that can both encrypt, decrypt or quit the program depending
            on what the user decides to do. It has a decryption key that is hardly possible to decipher as it combines two seperate 
            characters to form an encrypted message. You could also decrypt a message within seconds based on the user's choice whether or whether not to.It has been used by many companies as it is very fast and easy to use and understand.</p>
